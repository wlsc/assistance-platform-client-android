<p>(Abstract) In the time of rapidly increasing pace of digital lifestyle, users increasingly rely on useful and timely information
provided by the Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA). As users get more accustomed to using IPA solutions on a daily
basis, their expectations grow and the requests become more complex. Nonetheless, the development of full-stack
IPA solution for multiple use cases remains complex, due to excessive effort it still requires.</p>

<p>The state of the art IPA solutions (e.g., Siri and Google Now) do have the capacity to comprehend users’ behavior
by tracking them through multiple devices and analyzing their personal data. Due to commercial nature of popular
IPA solutions, they are characterized by little, if any, ﬂexibility to allow the extension of the platform by third-
parties. In contrast to commercial, most of the similar research solutions are open to public access (e.g., Device
Analyzer and Sirius). However, they are often designed for a single use case, which limits their assistance capability
for additional use cases.</p>

<p>This application addresses the issue of multi-app approach by developing a generic Android-based IPA application,
which acts as base frame for multiple assistance use cases. The concept is built upon the principle of modular
architecture, aimed to enable the consolidated utilization of common key functionalities (e.g., tracking, sensor
data upload or user interfaces), and provide an interface for the new use cases, deﬁned as modules. Developers are
now able to develop new assistance use cases easily, without the need for client-side modiﬁcations. The evaluation
of the implemented prototype shows that the proposed solution is able to cover multiple use cases in an energy-
efﬁcient and generic way without affecting the user experience.</p>
